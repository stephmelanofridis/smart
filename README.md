# Final Project - smArt shop
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

For the final project we were required to create an application using React for the front end, Graph QL with a Node.js and Express.js server, MongoDB and Mongoose for the database, queries and mutations for receiving, adding, updating and deleting data and then have the app deployed to Heroku. For the project I was inspired by my love of art to create an e-commerce site were I could sell original artwork and restored furniture.
